# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental Machine Learning algorithms written **from scratch using only NumPy and basic Python**, without relying on libraries like scikit-learn. It is built for learning purposes and to develop a deep understanding of how these algorithms work internally.

# Goal

To **learn** and **understand** how machine learning algorithms work behind the scenes by implementing them manually without using any machine learning libraries.

---

#Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

# Datasets Used

- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (`sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`)
- Synthetic data for regression/classification
- Toy datasets generated using NumPy and `make_classification` / `make_regression` from `sklearn.datasets`

---

# Visualizations

Where applicable, decision boundaries and model predictions have been plotted using `matplotlib`.

---

# Learning Outcomes

By implementing these algorithms from scratch, you will:
- Understand the core logic and math behind ML models
- Learn how optimization (like gradient descent) works
- Gain deeper intuition into hyperparameters and their effects
